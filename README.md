# CIFAR 10 Classification and Surface Normal Estimation using PyTorch
This repository contains implementations of convolutional neural networks for two computer vision tasks: 
(1) an improved BaseNet architecture achieving 85% accuracy on CIFAR-10 image classification through systematic enhancements like data augmentation, batch normalization, and architecture scaling
(2) a U-Net style network with skip connections for surface normal estimation that preserves spatial details and significantly improves upon baseline performance metrics.
